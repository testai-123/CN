for SSL (12):

1} unsecured (to show that password and username 
              is visible when ssl is not present ):

-testphp.vulnweb/login.php -> 
                           username : test ; password : test

-in wireshark-> search http -> go for smth like:{HTTP	726	POST /userinfo.php HTTP/1.1  (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)}
-go to html form url encoded

2} secured (facebook)(to show that login passwrd is
                      not visible when ssl is used):

-facbook login 
-stop capturing
--search ssl && ip.addr==31.13.79.35 
   -- you can search ip addr of fb by
       doing ping www.facebook.com in
        the command prompt
-show certificate exchange,handshake messages, 
 client hello ,server hello
- and in application data -> transport layer security -> encrypted application data(which is the password)
     { the actual data exchanged between the client and the server is encrypted to ensure secure communication
       which includes hexadecimal string and length indicator.}

10TH PS :FACEBOOK:

a) tcp:
   -- stop capturing after login
   -- search ip.addr==<fb_ipaddr> && tcp.port==443 {443 is for https -secured websites}
  -- go to file -> export packet dissection -> plain text ->save
b) http:

c) for flags (SYN,PSH,ACK,etc):
   --after login,stop
   --find manually at the last fb ip at src and pc ip at dest
   --in transmission control , show flags mentioned
d)packet length:
  --stop -> statsistics -> packet lenghts -> apply filter tcp && ip.addr==<pc_ipaddr> -> save
